# App Ticket Manager

An intelligent ticket management system developed on **OutSystems ODC**. This application revolutionizes support workflows by integrating two powerful AI Agents built with the **AI Agent Builder** and **GPT-3.5-turbo-16k**. The first agent analyzes the tone of a ticket to help prioritize requests (positive, neutral, or aggressive), while the second provides an immediate, context-aware first response by analyzing a knowledge base, significantly reducing resolution time. This project showcases the power of AI to automate and enhance customer support operations.
